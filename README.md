# MIPS-Single-Cycle-Processor
Verilog HDL of a single-cycle MIPS processor.

In this project, an attempt is made to recreate a single-cycle (no pipelining) MIPS processor, capable of implementing a reduced instruction set.

Specifically, the aim of the project is to successfully implement the following instructions: 
  load word, 
  store word, 
  branch if equal,
  branch if not equal,
  add immediate, 
  all J-format instructions, 
  all R-format instructions.
  
This project was inspired by a project assigned in CE4304 at UTD aimed at implementing the logic for the control unit and a few other key elements.
